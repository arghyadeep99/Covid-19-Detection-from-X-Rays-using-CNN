A simple attempt at trying to detect Corona Virus from X Ray scans of lungs. This is not a fullproof mechanism. Please don't publish it or deploy for medical use anywhere. 

## Disclaimer:

Before starting this notebook, kindly take strict note of the following:

1. The methods proposed here are in no way scientifically proven to help or detect Coronavirus convincingly. 

2. The work of this notebook should not be published in any kind of journals or research dataset. The research on Covid-19 is already burdened with community research that aren't proven to be effective and it is proving to be a menance. 

3. This notebook is just our novel attempt at trying to solve this global pandemic as deep learning researchers closely work with medical researchers to improve diagnosis. 

4. Recent researches have shown CT scans to be more helpful for detecting Corona Virus as compared to X-Ray scans. 

5. The dataset is scarce as it is hand curated, as abundance of scans aren't available for Corona positive and negative cases. 

**6. This notebook is a part of our Internal Assessment-1 under the course "Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic".**

## Objective and Motivation

COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, we can use X-rays to analyze the health of a patient’s lungs. Given that nearly all hospitals have X-ray imaging machines, it could be possible to use X-rays to test for COVID-19 without the dedicated test kits.

A drawback is that X-ray analysis requires a radiology expert and takes significant time — which is precious when people are sick around the world. Therefore developing an automated analysis system is required to save medical professionals valuable time.
